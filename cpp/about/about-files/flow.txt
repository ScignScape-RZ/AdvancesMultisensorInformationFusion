The Flow measurements calculate the flow of oxygenated air (as needed for 
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices) given inputs of ambient temperature 
and sound time travel.  The third (nested) row beneath the Flow value shows each 
sample's Flow 'rank' (where lower ranks mean that a sample has less Flow; the rank #1 
is the sample with least flow).  The second nested value shows each sample's flow 
measurement as a fraction of the maximum measurement in the test series (scaled so that 
the minimum flow value becomes zero).
