Oxygen Level
%%
The Oxygen measurements calculate Oxygen levels in oxygenated air (as needed for 
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices) given inputs of ambient temperature 
and sound time travel.  The measured levels range between 80% and 90%.  
The second row beneath the Oxygen value shows each 
sample's Oxygen 'rank' (where lower ranks mean that a sample has less Oxygen).  
The row directly beneath the raw Oxygen value shows each sample's Oxygen 
measurement as a fraction of the maximum measurement in the test series (scaled so that 
the minimum Oxygen value becomes zero).
