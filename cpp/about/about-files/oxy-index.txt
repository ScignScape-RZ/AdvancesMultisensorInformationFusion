The Oxygen measurements calculate Oxygen levels in oxygenated air (as needed for 
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices) given inputs of ambient temperature 
and sound time travel (copy values from the 'Index' column while the 
'Flow' tab is active to get a list of all samples ordered by Oxygen measurement).
