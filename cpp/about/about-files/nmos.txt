NMOS refers to subjective judgments of the quality for each audio sample
in terms of the background noise -- where high quality means that background 
does not disrupt understanding the important content in each sample.  Quality  
is measured on a scale of 1-5 (5 being highest quality or the most 
'non-disruption', that is, the least disruption from background noise).
