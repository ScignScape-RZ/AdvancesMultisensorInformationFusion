The Temperature measurement is a direct (physical) input used as a basis 
for calculating the flow of oxygenated air and oxygen levels.  
The main value is shown in degrees celcius, while the 
(nested) row beneath this value shows degrees Kelvin 
(used as an intermediate calculation).  
The third nested row beneath the Temperature value shows each 
sample's Temperature 'rank' (where lower ranks mean that a sample has less 
Temperature; the rank #1 
is the sample having the lowest measured temperature).  
The second nested value shows each sample's temperature
measurement as a fraction of the maximum temperature in the test series (scaled so that 
the minimum temperature value becomes zero).
