Time With Flow
%%
The 'Time with Flow' measurements are a direct physical measurement of 
sound travel time in a fixed direction (determined by sensor placement), understood 
to be a measurement of sound travel time 'with flow' insofar as this time 
is presumed to be shortened due to the sound traveling in a direction parallel to 
the air flow.  This value, along with 'Time against Flow', provides a physical strategy 
for calculating the air flow itself (assumed to be proportionate to the 
degree of difference between time-with-flow and time-against-flow).  
The (nested) row beneath the 'Time with Flow' value shows the average of 
time-with-flow and time-against-flow, used as an intermediate calculation.
