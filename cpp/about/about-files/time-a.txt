Time Against Flow
%%
The 'Time against Flow' measurements are a direct physical measurement of 
sound travel time in a fixed direction (determined by sensor placement), understood 
to be a measurement of sound travel time 'against flow' insofar as this time 
is presumed to be lengthened due to the sound traveling in a direction against  
the air flow.  This value, along with 'Time with Flow', provides a physical strategy 
for calculating the air flow itself (assumed to be proportionate to the 
degree of difference between time-with-flow and time-against-flow). 
The (nested) row beneath the 'Time against Flow' value shows the difference (delta) 
of time-with-flow and time-against-flow, used as an intermediate calculation.
